# Hospital-Management-System
This system is developed to manage patients and doctors in the hospital, where the system will
enable the patients to get appointment and also help doctor to manage their patients
The project is a simple C++ hospital management system that allows users to manage doctors,
patients, and appointments. It uses classes to represent doctors, patients, and appointments, with
inheritance used for doctors and patients derived from a base class, Person.
## Key functionalities include:-
● Adding new doctors and patients to the system.

● Booking appointments between doctors and patients, specifying the date and time.

● Listing all doctors and patients in the system.

● Displaying appointments for a specific patient or appointments with a specific doctor.

● Retrieving information about doctors and patients by their unique IDs.

● This project provides a basic framework for managing hospital data, including doctor specialties and patient appointments, while demonstrating object-oriented programming
concepts in C++.

The Hospital Management System is a C++ program designed to facilitate the management of hospital operations, focusing on doctors, patients, and their appointments. It employs
object-oriented programming principles to represent entities and their relationships within a healthcare environment.

### Key Features:
The system allows hospital administrators to add new doctors with their unique IDs, names, and specialties. It also enables the addition of patients with their unique IDs and names.

#### Appointment Booking:
Hospital staff can create appointments between doctors and patients. Appointments are scheduled
with specified dates and times.

#### Listing and Information Retrieval:
The system provides the ability to list all doctors and patients in the system. Doctors are listed with
their names, IDs, and specialties, while patients are listed with their names and IDs.
It allows users to retrieve information about a specific doctor or patient by searching with their
unique IDs.

#### Appointment Management:
The system can display appointments for a particular patient, showing which doctors they have
appointments with. Users can also view appointments for a specific doctor, indicating the patients
scheduled to meet them.

#### Object-Oriented Approach:
The project showcases the use of classes and inheritance to model real-world entities. It defines a
base class, Person, and derives two subclasses, Doctor and Patient, from it. Each class is equipped
with relevant attributes and methods for data storage and retrieval.

#### User Interaction:
The program provides a text-based user interface for adding doctors and patients, creating
appointments, listing entities, and retrieving information. It prompts users for input when adding
data, ensuring ease of use and interactivity.

#### Data Integrity:
The system incorporates error handling and validation to prevent the creation of duplicate doctors or
patients. It also checks the existence of doctors and patients before booking appointments to
maintain data integrity
